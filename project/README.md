# Unit 3 Project: Japanese Vocab Revision App

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

My client, Daiichiro, is a student of ISAK. He loves music very much and often listens to music subscription services. And one of the features in the subscription service is that you can register your favorite songs. However, although the favorite songs feature allows you to make a list of your favorite songs, it is difficult to create playlists by genre or by mood you want to listen to. For this reason, we need an application that allows us to create new lists of our favorite songs and listen to them by category. Compared to the analog method of writing in a notebook, the digital method is more efficient because the necessary data is saved each time, and the risk of loss is reduced. Also, with analog, it is easy to write down data, but very labor intensive to correct it. Also, sorting through a list of favorite songs is time-consuming. In contrast, digital data can be added, deleted, and rearranged in a snap. The application also allows you to enter information such as when the song was added, the author, the year it was released, and a link to the song's subscription application.
and log it!
## Proposed Solution

### Design Statement

To meet the needs of my client, Daiichiro, I propose to create an application that will allow him to manage and organize his favorite songs. The application would allow him to create customized playlists based on his genre and mood, and to enter information such as the date the song was added, its author, year of release, and links to subscription services. The proposed solution is designed using Python as the primary programming language, KivyMD for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQLAlchemy for database management.

### System Overview

The application will be developed in PyCharm version 2022.3.2 (Professional Edition) and will use the macOS Ventura version 13.0.1 operating system on a 2021 MacBook Air M1. It will use Python as the primary programming language and will employ KivyMD to create a user-friendly graphical interface. SQLAlchemy will be used to manipulate and manage the application's database.

### Software Justification

Python

Python will be used as the primary programming language for several reasons. Firstly, Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with a simple syntax that is easy to understand, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Additionally, Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages, with a vast online community and a plethora of resources available to aid in its development<sup>[[1]](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022)</sup>. Secondly, Python is a language that I am most comfortable coding in, and its object-oriented programming framework is modular and flexible, making it ideal for this project<sup>[[2]](https://www.educba.com/advantages-of-oop/)</sup>.

## List of techniques used

1. 

## Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition

In computational thinking, decomposition refers to breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive,
understand, program, and maintain.

#### Pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction



#### Algorithms



## Development

#### OOP

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

In order to validate our concept of creation, we created a MVP as a prototype to make sure our concept is reliable and
achievable.
