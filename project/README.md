# Unit 3 Project: Japanese Vocab Revision App

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

My client, Daiichiro, is a student of ISAK. He loves music very much and often listens to music subscription services. And one of the features in the subscription service is that you can register your favorite songs. However, although the favorite songs feature allows you to make a list of your favorite songs, it is difficult to create playlists by genre or by mood you want to listen to. For this reason, we need an application that allows us to create new lists of our favorite songs and listen to them by category. Compared to the analog method of writing in a notebook, the digital method is more efficient because the necessary data is saved each time, and the risk of loss is reduced. Also, with analog, it is easy to write down data, but very labor intensive to correct it. Also, sorting through a list of favorite songs is time-consuming. In contrast, digital data can be added, deleted, and rearranged in a snap. The application also allows you to enter information such as when the song was added, the author, the year it was released, and a link to the song's subscription application.
and log it!
## Proposed Solution

### Design Statement

To meet the needs of my client, Daiichiro, I propose to create an application that will allow him to manage and organize his favorite songs. The application would allow him to create customized playlists based on his genre and mood, and to enter information such as the date the song was added, its author, year of release, and links to subscription services. The proposed solution is designed using Python as the primary programming language, KivyMD for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQLAlchemy for database management.

### System Overview

The application will be developed in PyCharm version 2022.3.2 (Professional Edition) and will use the macOS Ventura version 13.0.1 operating system on a 2021 MacBook Air M1. It will use Python as the primary programming language and will employ KivyMD to create a user-friendly graphical interface. SQLAlchemy will be used to manipulate and manage the application's database.

### Software Justification

Python

Python will be used as the primary programming language for several reasons. Firstly, Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with a simple syntax that is easy to understand, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Additionally, Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages, with a vast online community and a plethora of resources available to aid in its development<sup>[[1]](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022)</sup>. Secondly, Python is a language that I am most comfortable coding in, and its object-oriented programming framework is modular and flexible, making it ideal for this project<sup>[[2]](https://www.educba.com/advantages-of-oop/)</sup>.

KivyMD

KivyMD will be used to create the graphical user interface for the application. It is an open-source library that can create beautiful and user-friendly graphical user interfaces. The GUI is essential in enabling the user to interact with the application and perform tasks such as adding, editing, and deleting songs, creating playlists, and sorting songs based on different categories.

SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy will be used to manipulate the database for the following reasons. Firstly, it is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that provides developers with the full power and flexibility of SQL"<sup>[[3]](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)</sup>.. As a result, I can take advantage of the SQL programming language, which is commonly used for managing databases<sup>[[4](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp)</sup>. Secondly, SQLAlchemy is an ORM, which allows me to manipulate and query data from the database using Python, my native programming language. This is beneficial since it eliminates the need to learn SQL, making development faster and more efficient<sup>[[5]](https://talentopia.global/back-end/orm-vs-plain-sql-which-should-you-choose-and-when)</sup>.

In conclusion, the proposed solution will address Daiichiro's need for a music management application that is more efficient than traditional analog methods. By utilizing Python, KivyMD, and SQLAlchemy, the application will be able to provide a user-friendly interface while allowing the user to organize their favorite songs easily.
